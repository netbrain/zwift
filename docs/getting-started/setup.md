# How do I connect my trainer, heart rate monitor, etc?

You can [use your phone as a bridge](https://support.zwift.com/using-the-zwift-companion-app-Hybn8qzPr).

For example, your Wahoo Kickr and Apple Watch connect to the Zwift Companion app on your iPhone; then the Companion app connects
over wifi to your PC running Zwift.

{: .note }
If you are using a direct connect (wifi or ethernet) enabled trainer, you may need to set `NETWORKING="host"` for Zwift to be
able to communicate to the device.
